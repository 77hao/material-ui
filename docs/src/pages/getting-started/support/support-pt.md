## Ajuda da comunidade (gr√°tis)

A comunidade √© sua primeira parada para perguntas e conselhos sobre o framework. Bem-vindo √† comunidade!

### StackOverflow

For crowdsourced answers from expert MUI developers in our community. StackOverflow is also frequented, from time to time, by the maintainers of MUI.

### GitHub

MUI uses GitHub issues as a bug and feature request tracker. Se voc√™ acha que encontrou um bug ou tem uma nova id√©ia de recurso, comece certificando-se de que ele ainda n√£o foi [relatado ou corrigido](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed). Voc√™ pode pesquisar nas issues existentes e pull requests para ver se algu√©m relatou algo semelhante ao seu.

#### Novas diretrizes para issues

- Please follow the issue template.
- Please begin the title with '[ComponentName]' where appropriate, and use a succinct description that helps others find similar issues.
  - "doesn't work" ‚ùå
  - "[Button] Add support for <some feature>" ‚úÖ
- Please don't group multiple topics in one issue ‚Äì each should have its own issue instead.
- Please don't comment "+1" on an issue. It spams the maintainers and doesn't help move the issue forward. Use GitHub reactions instead (üëç).

### Vers√µes suportadas

MUI Core has been open-source ([MIT](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license)) since the very beginning, and always will be. Developers can ensure MUI is the right choice for their React applications through MUI's community maintenance strategy. The MUI team regularly ships new releases, bug fixes, and is very welcoming to community pull requests.

Given the reality of time and resource constraints, as well as the desire to keep innovating, over time it becomes necessary to shift focus to newer versions of the framework ([our release schedule](https://mui.com/versions/#release-frequency)), while making the transition to newer versions as smooth as possible, including publishing migration guides such as [this one for v5](/guides/migration-v4/). The open-source community is always welcome to submit new features and bug fixes as well.

The current status of each MUI version is as follows:

- MUI Core v5 (emotion): ‚úÖ In active development.
- MUI Core v4 (hooks): ‚ö†Ô∏è Only handle security fixes.
- MUI Core v3 (change supported browsers): ‚ùå Inactive.
- ~MUI Core v2 (never existed)~.
- MUI Core v1 (rewrite): ‚ùå Inactive.
- MUI Core v0.x: ‚ùå Inactive.

For teams and organizations that require additional support for older versions, MUI has [options available](#professional-support-premium).

## Suporte profissional (premium)

### Pro/Premium plans

MUI comes in [three plans](/pricing/). The support available on the Community plan is mostly made possible thanks to people like you: the community. It's described in more detail in the above section. The maintainers of MUI focuses on solving the root issues, not direct support.

The Pro plan allows developers to license extra features that are challenging to find in the OSS space. The maintainers of MUI provide support for these paid features. They aim for a similar quality of experience to the one provided by the community on the open-source modules however no SLAs are provided.

The Premium plan goes one step further by providing SLAs on the quality of the support.

### Tidelift subscription

MUI and the maintainers of thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver one enterprise subscription that covers all of the open-source you use.

If you want the flexibility of open-source and the confidence of commercial-grade software, this is worth looking at.

The Tidelift Subscription manages your dependencies for you:

- Get the tools you need to continuously catalog and understand the open-source software that your application depends on.
- Your subscription helps pay the open-source community maintainers of the packages you use, to ensure they meet the standards you require.
- Address issues proactively, with tools that scan for new security, licensing, and maintenance issues, and alert participating open-source maintainers so they can resolve them on your behalf.
- Tidelift helps measure and improve your open-source dependencies' health ‚Äì which improves your app's health ‚Äì and gives a shortlist of high-impact steps your team can take to improve them even more.
- Get commercial assurances that don't come for free with open-source packages, such as intellectual property indemnification and support under a service level agreement. You expect these guarantees from proprietary software, and you can get them when using open-source as well.

The end result? All of the capabilities you expect from commercial-grade software, for the full breadth of open-source you use. That means less time grappling with esoteric open-source trivia, and more time building your own applications ‚Äì and your business.

### Custom work üõ†

Tweak MUI to meet specific requirements. Give us a summary of your needs and we'll help you if we can. We might:

- Give you an estimate of time and price if the work is straightforward
- Suggest alternatives that might not require MUI
- Decline the work due to timing or relevancy

Note that work must be MUI related. We don't accept general React development work. Our contracting price is $200/hour or $1,500/day.
